Tourist is a prodigy in competitve programming world. Once he was sleeping and dreaming.
As sometimes weird dreams come. That unlucky day he was learning maths from you,in his dream.
He was stuck at a maths problem and you had to help him. Tourist stated the problem to you :
you are given two integers 'p' and 'q' (q<=p). let num = (p!/q!) ^ (p+q)
( '!' denotes factorial , '^' denotes exponentiation ).
You can perform an operation over num,several times. Operation over num is defined as :
Choose a positive integer d (d>1),such that num is divisible by d, and replace num by num/d.
Now you have to make num equals to 1 in maximum number of operations.
Tourist wants to know the maximum possible number of operations.
